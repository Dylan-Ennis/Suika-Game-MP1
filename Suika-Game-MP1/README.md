# Suika-Game-MP1

## The name of my game is Suika game and it is an attempt at copying an already existing game with the same name.

## Description
-This is a game similar to Tetris where things fall from the top of the screen within a box. Instead of blocks the objects are fruit and when they collide with another fruit of the same color/type they turn into the next fruit untill you make it through the entire list of fruit or just get more and more points to your liking. 

##Rules
-There is a line at the top of the box and just like in Tetris, if you pass that line you lose and have to restart your game while losing your points.
-There are 11 fruits to get through and the final fruit is a watermelon (subject to change).
- Each fruit is worth different points and points are gained when the fruit appears after being combined. 
-You click to drop fruit from then top and line them up with other fruit to combine them, but the next fruit you get to drop is random from a set pool of the first 5 fruits.
-The point of the game is to get as many points as possible and reach the watermelon fruit at the end.
